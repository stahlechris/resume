# resume
A repository for code listed on my resume.
Project customermaintenancesql showcases connecting to a database and working with SQL & Java and should be looked at.
xml_assignment should also be looked at - it showcases my ability to work with XML files in a project.
The homemade projects showcase my ability to create data structures from scratch. This shows I understand how the "behind the scenes" work is going on when using collections in programs.

!Most of these projects are examples showcasing a certain skill I have.
This repo will be constantly updated.
