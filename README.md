# resume
<h1>A repository for code listed on my resume</h1>.<br>
<h2> Please take a look at "REPORT 3" firstly, it is one of my biggest projects.</h2><br>
Project customermaintenancesql shows my ability to connect to a database and work with SQL & Java.<br>
xml_assignment should also be looked at - it showcases my ability to work with XML files in a project.<br>
The homemade projects showcase my ability to create data structures from scratch. This shows I understand how the "behind the scenes" work is going on when using collections in programs.<br>

TradersAndTransactionsStreams and lambdaSolutions should be looked at as It shows that I am up to date in my primary OOP language, Java.

!Most of these projects are examples showcasing a certain skill I have.
This repo will be constantly updated.
