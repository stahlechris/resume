				VendingMachine Future Uses
1.) Declare multiple types of VendingMachine that hold snacks, snacks + drinks
2.) Different types of VendingMachines to carry more than 10
3.) Use a Beverage[] to hold a Beverage object (pepsi) and get rid of the quantity variable 
    then load the Beverage array into the map. Or use a stack...but figure out how you do a stack in java without pointers so you dont use vectors
